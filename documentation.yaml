- title: Creating and Deploying a Model
  description: Using Cloudera Machine Learning, you can create any function within
    a script and deploy it to a REST API as a model. In a machine learning project,
    this will typically be a predict function that will accept an input and return
    a prediction based on the model's parameters.
