- title: Inferring Concept Drift Without Labeled Data
  description: Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of a target domain
    change over time causing model performance to degrade. Drift detection is generally
    achieved by monitoring a performance metric of interest and triggering a retraining
    pipeline when that metric falls below some designated threshold. However, this
    approach assumes ample labeled data is available at prediction time - an unrealistic
    constraint for many production systems. In this report, we explore various approaches
    for dealing with concept drift when labeled data is not readily accessible.

- title: Exploring Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization
  description: We develop machine learning models against the “usual suspect” metrics
    like predictive accuracy, recall, and precision. However, these metrics are rarely
    truly all we care about. Production models must also satisfy physical requirements
    such as latency or memory footprint, or fairness constraints. Hyperparameter optimization
    becomes even more challenging when we have multiple metrics to optimize. Our latest
    research examines this “multi-objective” hyperparameter optimization scenario
    in detail.

- title: Deep Learning for Automatic Offline Signature Verification
  description: Handwritten signature verification aims to automatically discriminate
    between genuine and forged signatures, and is a particularly important challenge
    due to the ubiquity of handwritten signatures as a form of identification in legal,
    financial, and administrative domains. This research cycle explored the use of
    deep metric learning approaches - specifically siamese networks - combined with
    novel feature extraction methods to improve upon traditional techniques.

- title: Session-based Recommender Systems
  description: Recommendation systems have become a cornerstone of modern life, spanning
    sectors that include online retail, music and video streaming, and even content
    publishing. These systems help us navigate the sheer volume of content on the
    internet, allowing us to discover what’s interesting or important to us. A key
    trend over the past few years has been session-based recommendation algorithms
    that provide recommendations solely based on a user’s interactions in an ongoing
    session, and which do not require the existence of user profiles or their entire
    historical preferences.

- title: Few-Shot Text Classification
  description: Text classification can be used for sentiment analysis, topic assignment,
    document identification, article recommendation, and more. While dozens of techniques
    now exist for this fundamental task, many of them require massive amounts of labeled
    data in order to be useful. Collecting annotations for your use case is typically
    one of the most costly parts of any machine learning application. In this report,
    we explore how latent text embeddings can be used with few (or even zero) training
    examples and provide insights into best practices for implementing this method.

- title: Structural Time Series
  description: Time series data is ubiquitous. This report examines generalized additive
    models, which give us a simple, flexible, and interpretable means for modeling
    time series by decomposing them into structural components. We look at the benefits
    and trade-offs of taking a curve-fitting approach to time series, and demonstrate
    its use via Facebook’s Prophet library on a demand forecasting problem.

- title: Meta Learning
  description: In contrast to how humans learn, deep learning algorithms need vast
    amounts of data and compute and may yet struggle to generalize. Humans are successful
    in adapting quickly because they leverage their knowledge acquired from prior
    experience when faced with new problems. In this report, we explain how meta-learning
    can leverage previous knowledge acquired from data to solve novel tasks quickly
    and more efficiently during test time

  description: Automated question answering is a user-friendly way to extract information
    from data using natural language. Thanks to recent advances in natural language
    processing, question answering capabilities from unstructured text data have grown
    rapidly. This blog series offers a walk-through detailing the technical and practical
    aspects of building an end-to-end question answering system.
